    <p>I love listening to music. I canâ€™t play any instrument, but I do enjoy listening to each note in a song, identifying the instruments, getting emotional with the lyrics of a music piece. Getting those goosebumps.</p>

<p><img src="/img/sony-walkman.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Being a product of my time and age, I mostly listen to 80â€™s and 90â€™s songs, with some modern additions thrown into the mix. I hate Reggaeton and Trap with the power of a thousand suns, but thatâ€™s for a different post. I love Queen, Michael Jackson or Whitney Houston, but also all Soul and Motown classics from the 50â€™s and 60â€™s. And Spanish Pop music. But hell, I even listen to Opera, Video Game Soundtracks, Heavy or Chiptune. It depends on day and mood.</p>

<p>So I used to listen to music.</p>

<p>But in the past, I <em>used to listen to music</em>. Proper listening, I mean. With a Stereo HiFi system and good speakers. In vinyl first (that Madonnaâ€™s <em>Like a Prayer</em> record still smells <em>Patchouli</em> to this day), then with my first CDs. I was a teenager, with all the problems, doubts and pain of the age. And I listened to music to feel less sad, while still being sad. Sitting in a couch. Doing nothing else than listening to music.</p>

<p>Then times changed. Work, getting married, moving to a different city, having children. The complete maturing package. So I listened to music while going to work sitting in my car. Or while working in the office. Using a cheap MP3 player because <em>walkmans were so old</em>. Or in the computer. And then technology evolved. Wonderful streaming services suddenly put at your disposal thousands of songs.</p>

<p>But it wasnâ€™t the same. They didnâ€™t <em>sounded</em> the same. And itâ€™s not nostalgia. Itâ€™s just weâ€™ve become accustomed to <em>this sounds good enough</em>. While we seem to be in an endless pursue for the ultimate viewing experience (Full HD, then 4K, then 8K?) weâ€™ve given up on audio quality. People listen to music on smartphone speakers. Thatâ€™s a tiny, mono speaker most of the time. TV sets sport terrible speakers. So terrible in fact you end up buying a sound bar just to be able to understand dialogues. Nobody knows what HiFi is anymore. We had the best sound and we lose it, getting convenient, <em>good enough</em> sound in return.</p>

<p>But I missed that sound.</p>

<p><img src="/img/sony-walkman-madonna.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™ve just got a High Definition Audio player. In this case, a simple Sony NW-A55L. Nothing terrible fancy, but itâ€™s the first Walkman Iâ€™ve ever bought. Just looking at that branding in the box brought back lots of memories. When I lusted a Walkman when I was a teenager but only could get myself an Aiwa (that sounded really good, BTW). But now I have a proper Walkman. At last.</p>

<p>So Iâ€™ve started ripping my CD collection. After trying some formats Iâ€™ve settle down with something that seems reasonable for me: Apple Lossless / 24 bit. This produces files with CD quality, which is exactly what I want given the source of those files: a CD. And this thing sounds&hellip; glorious. Now I can sit, plug my Audio Technica M50x headphones and enjoy the music I like, the way I like the most.</p>

<p>It only took me 30 years to rediscover that I needed to listen properly to music. Go figure.</p>

<p>P.S.: no audiophiles been harmed in the making of this post.</p>
