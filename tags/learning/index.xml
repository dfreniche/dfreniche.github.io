      <description>You&amp;rsquo;re starting to learn any programming language. From Assemmbler to Clojure, from Swift to COBOL. At some point you&amp;rsquo;ll want to assign a value to a memory position. It can be a constant or a variable. You just want to change that memory position. This is something so basic that CPUs have lots a lots of operations devoted to moving data around: setting the CPU registers, copying blocks of bytes from one place to another, moving data into the stack, etc.</description>

      <description>In my last post I wrote about why I think Swift is not a simple language. After all, if you need powerful, expressive constructs you´ll end up having some degree of complexity in there. My critique was more about how they market it as simple for beginners, when sometimes I have to scratch my head to understand some code. I´m dumb as a rock, that&amp;rsquo;s for sure, but have been typing code since ´88.</description>

Apple markets Swift as The powerful programming language that is also easy to learn.
Nope.
Sorry to break this on you, but Swift is far from easy to learn. This is something I’ve been commenting in the past in Twitter, Slack and private conversations with other devs. To set a baseline, if I say Swift is not easy to learn, what would an easy to learn language look like?</description>
