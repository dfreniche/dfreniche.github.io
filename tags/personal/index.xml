      <description>6th of May will be my last &amp;ldquo;official&amp;rdquo; day at Teamwork. Now I&amp;rsquo;m on my 2nd Annual Leave week, so effectively I&amp;rsquo;m out of the company since last Friday April 23th. Leaving a job can or can&amp;rsquo;t be a big deal. It depends on how invested you&amp;rsquo;re in it, how much you need the money, your personal / finances situation, etc. For me, as excited and happy I am about my next role, this is a sad event.</description>

      <description>I love listening to music. I can’t play any instrument, but I do enjoy listening to each note in a song, identifying the instruments, getting emotional with the lyrics of a music piece. Getting those goosebumps.
Being a product of my time and age, I mostly listen to 80’s and 90’s songs, with some modern additions thrown into the mix. I hate Reggaeton and Trap with the power of a thousand suns, but that’s for a different post.</description>
