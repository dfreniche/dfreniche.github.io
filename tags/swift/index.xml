Apple markets Swift as The powerful programming language that is also easy to learn.
Nope.
Sorry to break this on you, but Swift is far from easy to learn. This is something I’ve been commenting in the past in Twitter, Slack and private conversations with other devs. To set a baseline, if I say Swift is not easy to learn, what would an easy to learn language look like?</description>

      <description>Sometimes I need to use a third party library (usually added to my project using CocoaPods) so I quickly grab it, integrate it and start adding code. But some frameworks are more difficult to understand, learn and use than others.
Recently I’ve been learning RxSwift. I learn by trying out some code while reading or watching videos. I really need to code for it to stick. I can create a full-blown project and add that RxSwift dependency via CocoaPods, but what I don’t want it’s all the other stuff that comes with a project: storyboards, ViewControllers, etc.</description>
